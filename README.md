# Hypothesis_Testing_SAS
An introduction to hypothesis testing in SAS and SPSS.
Type II errors are the worst type of errors to get. 
Alpha = Prob(Type I error) = False positive (False positive (Alpha) + True negative = 1)
Beta =  Prob(Type II error) = False negative (False negative (Beta) + True positive(power = 1)
- Negative = Null and Positive = Alternative
- In analysis Power is everything because one can miss big. Who knew someone in 1962 could miss out on the beatles?
- Which test is more powerful? 1-tailed Test
- Which test would more likely result in a Type I Error?   1-tailed Test makes sense because the experimenter is already leaning in one direction
- Which test would more likely result in a Type II Error?  2-tailed Test why because even the experimenter is unsure of the direction of the outcome so it means they are not willing to lean in one direction.
